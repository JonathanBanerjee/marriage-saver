## Initial commit

Title: Marriage Saver

About the project:
TEach year 100k+ people get divorced, and most of theses divorces are fault based. Forgetting an anniversary / birthday is **probably** one of the reasons! 

To help every husband and wives save their marriage, we've created an app to allow everyone to keep track of the most important dates of their partnerships. 

Elements of our app: 
- A login/logout section (working with a magic link sent right to your inbox)
- A dashboard which stores all your important dates
- A new event section to add all new dates in your app 

Built with: 
- React 
- Picocss library
- Supabase
